Image sitemap is one of the important SEO requirement but unfortunately it's not provided by Shopify in core features. 

Go to your Admin > Themes and "Edit Theme Code". Then you just need to create a new template and copy this code. Then save it, publish this template as a page. 

Check the XML URL in your Google Search Console account!
